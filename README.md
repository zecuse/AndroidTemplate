# Template

1. Before opening the project in Android Studio, open the settings.gradle and change the "rootProject.name" to your project name.
2. Load the project in Android Studio, open any file, hover over the "template" name in the package, and rename (default Shift + F6) it to the same project name.
3. Open the app's build.gradle and change "template" in the namespace and applicationId to the same project name.
4. Open strings.xml and change the "app_name" string's value to the same project name.
